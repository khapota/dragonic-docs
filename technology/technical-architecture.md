# Technical Architecture

$DRA token is built on top of the BSC Blockchain. 

Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) is a blockchain network designed for the execution of smart contract-based applications. BSC runs in parallel with Binance's native Binance Chain \(BC\), giving users the best of both worlds: BC's high transaction capacity and BSC's smart contract capability.
