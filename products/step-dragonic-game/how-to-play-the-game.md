# How to play the game



After you own the dragon warrior, you can join the combat with "Battle Zombic".

The rarer the dragon, the higher the level, the greater your win rate.

To participate in each battle, you will need to pay a small fee

Reward:

* After each win, you will receive $DRA corresponding to the type of Zombic you hit. And your dragon warrior will receive experience points to increase the level.
* After each battle, the dragon warrior will receive EXP points. Level 6 is the highest level.
* If you lose, you only lose the participation fee. And your dragon doesn't get any experience points.
