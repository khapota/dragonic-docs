# How to own a dragon warrior

To participate in the "Battle Zombic" battle, the player needs to own the dragon warrior. There are 2 ways to own them as follows: 

* Buy at "Dragonic" - This is the land of dragons, where dragons are born. The price for each type of dragon varies based on how rare they are. All dragons here are level 1 and your task is to train them to level up. 
* Buy on the Market, another way to own dragons is that you buy directly from the market - where other players post for sale. The price of dragons will depend on their level and rarity.
